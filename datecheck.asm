;this one im going to try and show the date
;so in this case, we are going to try and create a similar outcome to the C function for dateTime.

;first, let us think about how we want to display the datetime
;in this case, MM/DD/YYYY - 00:00
;now to do so, we have to declare and display each portion of the date time seperately,
;then compile them into one output
